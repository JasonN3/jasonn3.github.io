This is because sometimes SSSD would make a request to a DC on the domain and get the list of groups the user was a member of and sometimes it would make a request to a DC on the parent domain, which didn't have the list of groups the user was a member of resulting in SSSD thinking the user wasn't a member of any groups.",(0,i.kt)("br",{parentName:"p"}),"\n","To work around this missing option, it can be added to the SSSD configuration inside of the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"[domain/<domain>]")," section.")),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ignore_group_members = true"),"\nThis configuration option is counter intuitive.
