I\'ve seen admins create all users on all machines, others that share accounts using SSH keys or even passwords, and still others that use LDAP binding (sometimes using the existing Active Directory infrastructure and sometimes using a separate domain) which requires them to write LDAP queries to filter access. All these methods make managing access to machines difficult, and they require the admins to be informed when someone has left or joined a team. Shared accounts can make logging mostly useless as everyone will have the same username. And I\'m probably not alone in having a bad experience with HR informing technical teams when there\'s a change to a team. However, there\'s a way I\'ve found that works well and integrates with what is typically a pre-existing process.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/active-directory/realm":{"id":"RH/active-directory/realm","title":"Why I don\'t use RealmD","description":"RealmD can sometimes be utilized as a shortcut for joining a system to AD. Unfortunately, it skips a few quality of life options and some required options. I\'ve come across a lot of people that have joined their systems to AD and ended up with the machines falling off the domain, dealing with slow logins, or complaining there\'s no way to manage who can log in. Using the method described here, I\'ve had machine stay on the domain for years with no problems, all of the logins were fast, and I could easily manage who could log in and I even could have added SSH keys if I wanted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/config-management":{"id":"RH/satellite/config-management","title":"Settings Configurations on Client Machines","description":"This is done using Puppet.

However, you can\'t directly boot an ISO. Instead you need to convert it to a VHD. Here are the steps to convert the bootdisk Satellite creates in to a VHD that you can then use in Azure.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/provisioning":{"id":"RH/satellite/provisioning","title":"Machine Provisioning","description":"There a few choices to get everything started, but the processes have fairly similar dependencies","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/puppet/git-repo":{"id":"RH/satellite/puppet/git-repo","title":"Configuring your git repo for Puppet","description":"Branches","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/remote-execution":{"id":"RH/satellite/remote-execution","title":"Remote Execution Jobs","description":"Remote Exection Jobs can be used to accomplish tasks remotely. Satellite supports jobs written in either Bash or Ansible. I would recommend you write them in Ansible. Because Ansible is idempotent, you don\'t need to worry about running it multiple times against the same machine and is less likely to cause an issue with your machines. The version of Ansible built in to Satellite does have some limitations but is a good starting point. As your usage of Ansible expands, you may want to look in to AAP. Satellite and AAP can share information so actions are taken on AAP while the inventory is stored in Satellite.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
