I\'ve seen admins create all users on all machines, others that share accounts using SSH keys or even passwords, and still others that use LDAP binding (sometimes using the existing Active Directory infrastructure and sometimes using a separate domain) which requires them to write LDAP queries to filter access. All these methods make managing access to machines difficult, and they require the admins to be informed when someone has left or joined a team. Shared accounts can make logging mostly useless as everyone will have the same username. And I\'m probably not alone in having a bad experience with HR informing technical teams when there\'s a change to a team. However, there\'s a way I\'ve found that works well and integrates with what is typically a pre-existing process.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
