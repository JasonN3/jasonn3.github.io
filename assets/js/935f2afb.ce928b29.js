I\'ve seen admins create all users on all machines, others that share accounts using SSH keys or even passwords, and still others that use LDAP binding (sometimes using the existing Active Directory infrastructure and sometimes using a separate domain) which requires them to write LDAP queries to filter access. All these methods make managing access to machines difficult, and they require the admins to be informed when someone has left or joined a team. Shared accounts can make logging mostly useless as everyone will have the same username. And I\'m probably not alone in having a bad experience with HR informing technical teams when there\'s a change to a team. However, there\'s a way I\'ve found that works well and integrates with what is typically a pre-existing process.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/config-management":{"id":"RH/satellite/config-management","title":"Settings Configurations on Client Machines","description":"This is done using Puppet.

Here are the steps to convert the bootdisk Satellite creates in to a VHD that you can then use in Azure.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/provisioning":{"id":"RH/satellite/provisioning","title":"Machine Provisioning","description":"There a few choices to get everything started, but the processes have fairly similar dependencies","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/puppet/git-repo":{"id":"RH/satellite/puppet/git-repo","title":"Configuring your git repo for Puppet","description":"Branches","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"RH/satellite/remote-execution":{"id":"RH/satellite/remote-execution","title":"Remote Execution Jobs","description":"Remote Exection Jobs can be used to accomplish tasks remotely. Satellite supports jobs written in either Bash or Ansible. I would recommend you write them in Ansible. Because Ansible is idempotent, you don\'t need to worry about running it multiple times against the same machine and is less likely to cause an issue with your machines. The version of Ansible built in to Satellite does have some limitations but is a good starting point. As your usage of Ansible expands, you may want to look in to AAP. Satellite and AAP can share information so actions are taken on AAP while the inventory is stored in Satellite.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
