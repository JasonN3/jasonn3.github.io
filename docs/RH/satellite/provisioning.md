# Machine Provisioning
There a few choices to get everything started, but the processes have fairly similar dependencies

## Configuring PXE with DHCP Options
Configure your DHCP server with the following options. Option 67 should return different values depending on the `user-class`. Most DHCP servers can handle conditional return values.

| Option Name | Option Number | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| next-server | 66 | Set to the TFTP server that hosts iPXE's boot file. This can be the Satellite server or another server |
| filename | 67 | - Initially set to the boot file on the TFTP server. Satellite uses `pxelinux.0` <br /> - When `user-class = "iPXE"`, it should return the iPXE script. By default this is `http://<satellite_server>:8000/unattended/iPXE` |

## Download the boot disk for PXE without DHCP Options
1. Log in to the web interface of the Satellite server
1. Browse to `Infrastructure` -> `Subnets`
1. On the row for one of your subnets, click the arrow down **next to** `Delete` and select `Subnet generic image`  
The `Subnet generic image` will contain iPXE with a script to override the DHCP options required for PXE booting.  
The only subnet specific information stored in the image is the `Template Capsule` as that is used when downloading the template files. As long as you are using the same `Template Capsule`, you can use the image on multiple subnets

## Deploying a host
1. Log in to the web interface of your Satellite server
1. Browse to `Hosts` -> `Create Host` on the menu
1. Enter the machine name and fill out any information that is needed about the machine
1. Boot the machine from PXE or from the boot disk you downloaded
